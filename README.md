# Stower - Read-It-Later App

A clean, modern read-it-later app that saves articles for offline reading across all your devices. Built natively for iOS and macOS with SwiftUI and CloudKit sync.

## Features

- **Save articles instantly** from Safari or any app using the Share Extension
- **Distraction-free reading** with clean, formatted text extraction
- **Cross-platform sync** between iPhone, iPad, and Mac via CloudKit
- **Customizable reading experience** with themes, fonts, and layout options
- **Offline reading** - articles are saved locally for access anywhere
- **Smart content extraction** that removes ads and clutter
- **Tagging and organization** to keep your reading library organized

## Project Architecture

This project uses a **workspace + SPM package** architecture for clean separation between platform-specific app shells and shared business logic.

## Development

### Getting Started

1. **Open the workspace**: `Stower.xcworkspace` (not the individual .xcodeproj files)
2. **Choose your target**: Select either `Stower` (iOS) or `StowerMac` (macOS) scheme
3. **Build and run**: The app will launch with sample data in debug mode

### Key Architecture Points

- **App Shells**: iOS and Mac app targets contain minimal lifecycle code
- **Feature Packages**: All business logic lives in the SPM packages (`StowerPackage` & `StowerMacPackage`)
- **Shared Models**: Core data models and services are shared between platforms
- **Platform Adaptations**: Each platform has its own package for UI adaptations

### Code Organization

- **iOS Development**: Work primarily in `StowerPackage/Sources/StowerFeature/`
- **Mac Development**: Work primarily in `StowerMacPackage/Sources/StowerMacFeature/`
- **Shared Models**: Located in `StowerPackage/Sources/StowerFeature/Models/`
- **Services**: Content extraction, CloudKit sync in `StowerPackage/Sources/StowerFeature/Services/`

### Tech Stack

- **Language**: Swift 6.1+ with strict concurrency
- **UI Framework**: SwiftUI (iOS 18.0+, macOS 15.0+)
- **Data**: SwiftData with CloudKit sync
- **Testing**: Swift Testing framework (not XCTest)
- **Architecture**: Model-View (MV) pattern using SwiftUI's built-in state management
- **Concurrency**: Swift Concurrency (async/await, actors, @MainActor)

## Features Overview

### Content Extraction
- Smart HTML parsing with SwiftSoup

- Preserves formatting, links, and images
- Converts to clean Markdown for consistent rendering

### Reading Experience
- Multiple reading themes (Light, Dark, Sepia, High Contrast)
- Customizable fonts and sizes
- Adjustable line spacing and margins
- Distraction-free fullscreen reading mode

### Sync & Storage
- CloudKit integration for seamless sync across devices
- Offline-first architecture - works without internet
- App Groups for sharing data between main app and Share Extension
- Automatic background processing of saved URLs

### Platform Features

#### iOS Specific
- Share Extension for saving from Safari and other apps
- Native iOS navigation and controls
- Optimized for iPhone and iPad

#### macOS Specific

- Native macOS document handling

## Configuration

### CloudKit Setup
The app uses CloudKit for cross-device sync. Container identifier: `iCloud.com.ryanleewilliams.stower`

### App Groups
Enables data sharing between main app and Share Extension: `group.com.ryanleewilliams.stower`

### Bundle Identifiers
- **iOS App**: `com.ryanleewilliams.stower`
- **macOS App**: `com.ryanleewilliams.stower`
- **Share Extension**: `com.ryanleewilliams.stower.share`

## Testing

### Test Structure
- **Swift Testing**: Modern testing framework with `@Test` macros
- **Unit Tests**: Business logic testing in package test targets
- **UI Tests**: Platform-specific UI automation tests
- **Test Plans**: Coordinated test execution with `.xctestplan` files

### Running Tests

# iOS tests
xcodebuild test -workspace Stower.xcworkspace -scheme Stower -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16'

# Mac tests  
xcodebuild test -workspace Stower.xcworkspace -scheme StowerMac -destination 'platform=macOS'
```

## Building & Distribution
